[*SparkFun RTK Surveyor (SPX-17369)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17369)

The SparkFun RTK Surveyor is an easy to use GNSS receiver for centimeter-level positioning. Perfect for surveying, this preprogrammed device can also be used for autonomous driving, navigation, asset tracking and any other application where there is a clear view of the sky. The RTK Surveyor can also be used as a base station. With the flick of a switch, two RTK Surveyors can be used to create an RTK system capable of 14mm horizontal positional accuracy. The built-in Bluetooth connection via an ESP32 WROOM enables the user to use the RTK Surveyor with their choice of GIS application on a phone or tablet. The built in battery allows field use for up to four hours and is compatible with common USB battery banks.

This repo houses the hardware for the product including the PCB design, enclosure, and graphic overlay. The firmware for the RTK Surveyor (and other SparkFun RTK products) can be found [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware).
